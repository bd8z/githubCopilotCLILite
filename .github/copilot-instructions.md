## Build, Test, and Lint Commands
No build, test, or lint scripts were found in this repository. If you add any, document them here for future Copilot sessions.

## High-Level Architecture
This repository currently contains only an `env` directory with a single environment variable file. No source code, configuration files, or application logic were detected. If you add code, describe the main components and their relationships here.

## Key Conventions
No custom conventions or patterns were found. If you introduce any, note them here for Copilot and other AI assistants.

## Integration with AI Assistant Configs
No relevant AI assistant configuration files (Claude, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, Aider, Cline) were found, except for a custom agent YAML for weather briefing in `.copilot/agents/weather-briefing.yaml`. If you add more, summarize their purpose and usage here.
